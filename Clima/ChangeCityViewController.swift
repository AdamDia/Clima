import UIKit


//Write the protocol declaration here:
protocol ChangeCityDelegate {
    func userEnteredANewCityName(city : String)
}


class ChangeCityViewController: UIViewController {
    
    //Declare the delegate variable here:
    var delegate : ChangeCityDelegate?
    
    //This is the pre-linked IBOutlets to the text field:
    @IBOutlet weak var changeCityTextField: UITextField!

    
    //This is the IBAction that gets called when the user taps on the "Get Weather" button:
    @IBAction func getWeatherPressed(_ sender: AnyObject) {
        
        
        //1 Get the city name the user entered in the text field
        let cityName = changeCityTextField.text!
        
        //2 If we have a delegate set, call the method userEnteredANewCityName
        //means if the delegate is not nill means the user entered some text inside the text field
        //delegate? (called Optional Chaining) what it's doing is checking to see if this optional with ? questions mark contains a value or if it is nil, So if it contains a value we will call useEnteredANewCityName function if not containing so we will ignore the entire row what i mean by have a Value is there is a delegate and we write in the weatherViewController
        //destinationVC.delegate = self so that is means the watherViewController is the delegate
        delegate?.userEnteredANewCityName(city: cityName)
        
        //3 dismiss the Change City View Controller to go back to the WeatherViewController
        self.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
        
    }
    
    

    //This is the IBAction that gets called when the user taps the back button. It dismisses the ChangeCityViewController.
    @IBAction func backButtonPressed(_ sender: AnyObject) {
        self.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
    
}
